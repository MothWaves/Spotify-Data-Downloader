* Information Gathering (Playlists):
- Get information for saved songs too (Liked Songs)
* Information Compilation:
- Implement json serialization on Classes.
- Make json file with important playlist information and all of the import track information contained within.
- Split the json between the ones the current_user didn't make and the ones the current_user did make (maybe collaborative too if you can figure out how to separate that)
- write the json files into a directory.
* Refactoring
- Change the passing of sp to each function that needs it into a singleton system.
