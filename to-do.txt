* Information Gathering (Playlists):
- Get username of current_user
- Get all the playlists
- While getting all the playlists split playlists not made by the current_user and playlists made by current_user
- Get information for saved songs too (Liked Songs)
* Information Gathering (Tracks):
- For each playlist get the track information of each track within the playlist.
* Information Compilation:
- Make json file with important playlist information and all of the import track information contained within.
- Split the json between the ones the current_user didn't make and the ones the current_user did make (maybe collaborative too if you can figure out how to separate that)
- write the json files into a directory.
